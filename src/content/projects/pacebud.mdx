PaceBud is Pace Calculator for runners that I built as a Progressive Web App. It can calculate either time, distance or pace when provided with the other two's data (ie to calculate time you need to provide input data to the distance and pace fields).
Being a Progressive Web App, PaceBud can be installed to your device and work offline.
