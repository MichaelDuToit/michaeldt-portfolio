My portfolio is (currently) built on NextJS with Markdown files, with Netlify for CI/CD and hosting.
NextJS is used as a static site generator, which with MDX for converts the Markdown files into HTML.
The site is hosted on Netlify which automatically builds and redeploys the site whenever a change push on the main branch to the Git Repository.
