My portfolio site is currently built with NextJS and Markdown filed with Netlify for CI/CD and hosting.
NextJS is used as a static site generator, with MDX for converting Markdown content files into HTML.
The site is hosted on Netlify which automatically builds and redeploys the site whenever a change is made to the Git Repository.
