Built for a local running club to upgrade their website to a more modern site with a content management system to make it easier for their Web Administrator to add and update content.
This was a full overhaul project, with a custom responsive theme, HTTPS and all content from their old site migrated over to the new site.

Built on GravCMS to provide the content management system, with Twig Templating, HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and Gulp (build tool) to create the custom themes and layouts.
